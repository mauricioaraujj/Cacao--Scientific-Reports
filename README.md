**"Multi‑trait selection for nutritional and physiological quality of cacao genotypes in irrigated and non‑irrigated environments"**

The study proposes a multi-trait selection framework to identify cacao genotypes with superior physiological and nutritional performance across contrasting irrigation regimes. Our goal is to support sustainable cacao breeding in variable environmental conditions.
